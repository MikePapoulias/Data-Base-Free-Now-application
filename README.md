Free Now application on a MySQL database.

# Description

This project, developed in the MySQL environment, aims to create a database (application) representing a simplified version of the Free Now service, which will store data related to transportation.
The data stored includes: vehicles (taxis, bicycles, scooters), customer information, employee/driver details, bookings and trips, payment details, trip reviews, company offices, and the maintenance/repair history of vehicles.
This application is used by customers to rent a vehicle and complete their payment, by employees to assist customers, and by drivers to communicate with users.
Upon completing the database design, sample records are created to verify that everything functions as intended. For completeness, the entity-relationship diagram, along with tables and comments, is included in the PDF containing the answers.
